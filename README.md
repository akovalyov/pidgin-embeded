# Version

Fork (currently unversioned) from on a [modified](#Modifications) copy of pidgin-embeddedvideo 1.2


# Modifications

- This repo contains a copy of a modified version of pidgin-embeddedvideo plugin, imported via tarball from: http://geekr.googlecode.com/files/pidgin-embeddedvideo-imageview.tar.gz
- This modified version includes basic rendering of images in chat windows as well as the underlying video support. More information can be found at http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-embeddedvideo/issues/detail?id=18
- Modified the regex for the youtube to support parsing of both http and https urls, as the original import only parsed http:// urls

# Todos

- The image rendering does not scale to the chat window size
- No customization on supported websites and types of rendering (images).
